        <h1>Master Your Roofing Projects with Our New Rafter Calculator</h1>
        <p>Roof framing is a critical part of any construction project, and calculating the correct rafter length is essential for a stable and well-formed roof. To simplify this process, we are excited to introduce our new Rafter Calculator, a free tool designed for both professional builders and DIY enthusiasts.</p>

        <h2>Why is a Rafter Calculator Important?</h2>
        <p>Guesswork has no place in construction. An inaccurate rafter measurement can lead to a series of problems, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wasted materials and increased costs.</li>
            <li>An unstable roof structure.</li>
            <li>Leaks and other structural damages over time.</li>
            <li>An uneven and aesthetically displeasing roofline.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our Rafter Calculator eliminates these risks by providing precise measurements based on your project's specific dimensions.</p>

        <h2>How to Use the Rafter Calculator</h2>
        <p>Using the tool is straightforward. You only need two key measurements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Run:</strong> This is the horizontal distance from the outside of the wall to the center of the ridge board.</li>
            <li><strong>Pitch:</strong> This is the slope of the roof, typically expressed as a ratio of rise over run (e.g., 4/12). You just need to enter the first number of the ratio.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you input these values into the calculator, it will instantly provide you with the exact length of the rafter required.</p>
