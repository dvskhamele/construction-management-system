            <h3>Example: Managing Blueprints and Permits for a New Build</h3>
            <p>Imagine you are managing a new commercial building project. You can use our system to log all your blueprints, permits, and contracts. As the blueprints go from "Draft" to "Pending Approval" and finally to "Approved," you can update their status in the system. This ensures that everyone on the team is always working with the most current and approved versions of critical documents, preventing costly errors on site.</p>

            <h2>Key Features of an Effective DMS</h2>
            <p>While our current system provides a foundational approach to document management, a truly effective Construction Document Management System (DMS) typically incorporates several key features to maximize efficiency and minimize risk:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Centralized Repository:</strong> A single, secure location for all project documents, accessible to authorized personnel from anywhere.</li>
                <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Automatically tracks changes and maintains a history of all document versions, ensuring everyone is always working with the latest approved revision.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control and Permissions:</strong> Granular control over who can view, edit, or approve specific documents, safeguarding sensitive information.</li>
                <li><strong>Search and Retrieval:</strong> Powerful search capabilities to quickly locate any document based on keywords, metadata, or categories.</li>
                <li><strong>Workflow Automation:</strong> Automates document routing for reviews, approvals, and distribution, streamlining processes and reducing manual effort.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration Capabilities:</strong> Ability to integrate with other project management software, BIM tools, and communication platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Accessibility:</strong> Access to documents on mobile devices for on-site viewing and updates.
