                <p class="lead">Maintaining high quality and addressing issues promptly are critical for successful construction project delivery. BuildMate is pleased to announce our new <strong>Construction Defect Tracker</strong>, a simple yet powerful tool to help you manage and resolve project defects efficiently.</p>
                
                <h2 class="mt-5">Why a Defect Tracker is Essential</h2>
                <p>Effective defect management leads to better project outcomes, reduced rework, and increased client satisfaction. Our new tool helps you to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Systematically log and categorize all identified defects.</li>
                    <li>Assign responsibility and set due dates for resolution.</li>
                    <li>Monitor the status of defects from identification to resolution.</li>
                    <li>Improve overall quality control and handover processes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="mt-5">How Our Tool Works</h2>
                <p>The Construction Defect Tracker provides an intuitive interface to record key information about each defect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Description:</strong> A detailed explanation of the issue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Precise location of the defect on the jobsite.</li>
                    <li><strong>Severity:</strong> Categorize defects as Low, Medium, or High to prioritize.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assigned To:</strong> Specify the individual or team responsible for the fix.</li>
                    <li><strong>Due Date:</strong> Set a target date for resolution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can easily add new defects, view a list of all logged issues, and mark them as resolved as they are addressed.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-5">Get Your Defect Summary Report</h2>
                <p>After logging your defects, you can generate a summary report.
