        <h1>Achieve Perfect Corners with Our Square-Up Calculator</h1>
        <p>In construction, precision is everything. Ensuring that corners are perfectly square is a fundamental requirement for the stability and integrity of any structure, from foundations to picture frames. To make this critical task easier, we've developed a simple and effective Square-Up Calculator.</p>

        <h2>The Importance of Square Corners</h2>
        <p>When corners are not square, it can lead to a cascade of problems throughout the construction process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structural Instability:</strong> Walls that are not square can compromise the overall stability of a building.</li>
            <li><strong>Misaligned Finishes:</strong> Flooring, tiles, and other finishes will not align correctly, resulting in a poor aesthetic and potential rework.</li>
            <li><strong>Compromised Integrity:</strong> Over time, structures with out-of-square corners can experience stress and strain, leading to cracks and other damage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our Square-Up Calculator uses the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) to help you verify that your corners are a perfect 90 degrees by measuring the diagonal.</p>

        <h2>How to Use the Square-Up Calculator</h2>
        <p>Using the calculator is as simple as measuring two sides of a rectangle:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Length:</strong> Measure the length of one side of your layout.</li>
            <li><strong>Width:</strong> Measure the length of the adjacent side.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The calculator will then instantly compute the required length of the diagonal for a perfect square corner. You can then measure the actual diagonal of your layout to see if it matches.</p>

        <h2>Ensure Precision in Your Projects</h2>
        <p>Don't leave the accuracy of your corners to chance. Use our free Square-Up Calculator to ensure your projects are built on a solid, square foundation.</p>
