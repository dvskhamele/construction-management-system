        <h1>Construction Gantt Chart Generator for Project Planning</h1>
        <p>Effective project planning and scheduling are paramount in the construction industry. A well-structured project plan ensures that tasks are completed on time, resources are allocated efficiently, and potential bottlenecks are identified and addressed proactively. One of the most widely used tools for project scheduling is the Gantt chart.</p>
        
        <h2>What is a Gantt Chart?</h2>
        <p>A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. It lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity. Gantt charts are incredibly useful for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visualizing Project Timelines:</strong> Clearly see the start and end dates of all project tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking Progress:</strong> Monitor the progress of individual tasks and the overall project.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Understand when resources are needed for specific tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Identifying Dependencies:</strong> See how tasks relate to each other and identify critical paths.</li>
        </ul>
