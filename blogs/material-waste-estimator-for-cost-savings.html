        <h1>Minimize Waste, Maximize Savings with Our Material Waste Estimator</h1>
        <p>Material waste is an unavoidable part of construction, but it doesn't have to be an unmanaged cost. Accurately accounting for waste is crucial for precise budgeting, efficient procurement, and sustainable project management. Our new Material Waste Estimator is designed to help you factor in expected waste, ensuring you order just the right amount of materials.</p>

        <h2>Why Estimate Material Waste?</h2>
        <p>Ignoring material waste can lead to significant financial and operational inefficiencies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Budget Overruns:</strong> Unexpected waste means unexpected costs, eating into your project's profitability.</li>
            <li><strong>Procurement Delays:</strong> Under-ordering due to unestimated waste can lead to costly delays waiting for additional deliveries.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Excessive waste contributes to landfill burden and goes against sustainable construction practices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By using our estimator, you can make more informed purchasing decisions and improve your project's bottom line.</p>

        <h2>How to Use the Material Waste Estimator</h2>
        <p>Our tool is straightforward and requires two key inputs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Total Material Needed:</strong> The net quantity of material required for your project (e.g., square footage of flooring, linear feet of lumber).</li>
            <li><strong>Estimated Waste Percentage:</strong> The anticipated percentage of waste for that specific material or task. This can vary based on material type, complexity of the work, and installer skill.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The calculator will then provide you with the total amount of material you should order to account for the expected waste.</p>

        <h2>Plan Smarter, Build Leaner</h2>
