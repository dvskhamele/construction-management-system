## Pages That Need Verification ⚠️

Some pages have overlapping terminology and may need to be checked individually to determine if they're construction-related implementations or hospitality implementations.

## Recommendations

1. Keep all construction-specific pages and components
2. Consider removing or renaming hospitality-related pages that don't apply to construction management
3. Ensure consistent navigation that focuses on construction management workflows
4. Verify that all dashboard components are construction-focused
5. Update any mixed terminology in shared components
